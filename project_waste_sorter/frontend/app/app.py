# Explain what the app is for
'''Recycling is essential if we want to help in the climate crisis. Countries and cities are improving their recycling protocoles and increasing their ressources so that
citizens are able to recycle a larger amount of garbage and do it in a more efficient way. As a consequence, the number
of different recycling bins are increasing rapidly in some cities like in Barcelona,
where you have 5 different containers for plastic/metal, paper, glass, organic and trash.

However, recycling protocoles might vary significantly from one city to the other. That's why citizens and, specially, tourists, might need some help
when trying to classify their garbage.
